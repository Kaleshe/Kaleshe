     <h2>Problem</h2>
       <p>Finding a good hairdresser is difficult for black women, who are forced to resort to social
       media platforms such as Instagram or Twitter when
       looking to find someone to do their hair.</p>

       <p>But it isnâ€™t only difficult for those looking to get their hair styled, it can also be
       challenging for stylists who are just starting out. As Instagram
       favours businesses with a higher follow count as opposed to distance and ratings.</p>
