					<h2>Do's & Don'ts</h2>
						<h3>Overthinking</h3>
							<p>Thinking about the worst-case scenario, and all of the things that could go wrong is never the right thing to do. 
							Always be sure to step back and take a realistic look, focusing on all of the things that could go right instead. 
							Whilst reassuring yourself that if anything does go wrong that it is not the end of the world.</p>
							
						<h3>Stop ruminating</h3>
							<p>Sitting there feeling sorry for yourself, dwelling on your bad mood will only make it worse. By getting 
							stuck into something you'll never be able change it, to make things better it is best to take action.</p>
						
						<h3>Be kind to yourself</h3>
							<p>Encouraging yourself can go along way, as words are very powerful, so beating yourself up and talking unkindly 
							to yourself will only make you feel worse. You need a friend, not an enemy.</p>
							
						<h3>Socialise</h3>
							<p>Isolating yourself from others may seem like the easiest things to do when feeling down, especially if
							you're in a sensitive state, but it will only make you feel worse. Keeping in touch with friends and seeing them
							regularly is a great way to uplift your mood.</p>
							
						<h3>Count your blessings</h3>
							<p>Sometimes we get so caught up in the bad that we forget about the good. By writing a long list of all of the things that you 
							love in your life, you will instantly realise some of the things that you're lucky to have, despite this tough time you're
							facing.</p>

					<h2>Treatment</h2>
						<p>Depression can be treated using various methods. Cognitive behavioural therapy and some forms of counselling and psychotherapy are proven 
						to work well for depression.</p>
						
					<h3 class="banner">Lifestyle Changes</h3>
					
					<h3>Exercise</h3>
						<p>Exercising boosts serotonin, endorphins, and other feel-good brain chemicals, it triggers the growth of new brain 
						cells and connections, just like antidepressants do. A half-hour daily walk can make a big difference.</p>
					
					<h3>Nutrition</h3>
						<p>Eating small, well-balanced meals throughout the day will help you keep your energy up and minimise mood swings. 
						Complex carbohydrates are a much better choice than the sugary foods you may be drawn to. Sugar only provides you 
						with a quick boost, which leaves you feeling drained after the all-too-soon sugar crash.</p>
						
					<h3>Sleep</h3>
						<p>Lack of sleep can worsen your depression symptoms. Sleep deprivation can make you feel irritable, moody, sad and fatigue.
						Ensure that you are getting at least 7 - 9 hours of sleep each night.</p>
						
					<h3>Social support</h3>
						<p>Be sure to keep regular contact with friends and family, joining a class or group. Volunteering is a great way to get social support and help 
						others while also helping yourself.</p>
						
					<h3>Stress reduction</h3>
						<p>Too much stress worsens depression. Make changes in your life that help you to manage and reduce stress. Take the aspects of your life that stress you out, 
						such as work overload or unsupportive relationships, and find ways to minimise their impact.</p>
