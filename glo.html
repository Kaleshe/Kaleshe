      <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Finding a good hairdresser is difficult for black women, who are forced to resort to social
        media platforms such as Instagram or Twitter when
        looking to find someone to do their hair.</p>

        <p>But it isnâ€™t only difficult for those looking to get their hair styled, it can also be
        challenging for stylists who are just starting out. As Instagram
        favours businesses with a higher follow count as opposed to distance and ratings.</p>
