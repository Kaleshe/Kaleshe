<p>Language partner is one of the best ways that langauge learners can improve their speaking skills in their target language.</p><p>
I've been studying Japanese for a number of years now and have always found it extremely challenging to find and maintain a serious language partner. </p><p>
Whilst there are many apps already available on the market dedicated to finding "serious" language exchange partners, the’re good for meeting people but I don’t feel like they’re good for meeting the right people. I’ve met more people than I can count on langauge exchanges platforms such as HelloTalk, ConversationExchange etc. of which I’m only in contact with about 5 of them people I’ve exchanged details with. After exchanging details and having a few conversations on Skype or Line, our relationships quickly fizzle out as it turns into a friendship rather than language exchange, which neither of us were set out for. 
<h2>Proposed Solution</h2><p>
An app dedicated to language exchange without all the fluff. Where users can establish serious language exchange relationships and manage them via the app, ensuring the relationship is focused on langauge exchange. Users can set goals and are also rewarded with badges and points to give them incentive to use the app.
<h2>Next Steps</h2><p>
Before building the app, I’m going to send out some surveys, so that I can identify language learners main pain points. Followed by a user journey and low fidelity prototype.
###The actual app will be built in phases (subject to change)
- Users will have basic details on their profile and a timeslot. Potential partners can book time slots for langauge exchange as single slots or sets (similar to italki)
- Partners can find eachother based on their timeslots and goals. Goals will be predefined in the system for users to select.
- Users will receive points for each completed language exchange session and badges for hitting milestones.</p><p>
I’ve never created anything like this before, so I am very much looking forward to embarking on this journey and sharing it with you!
